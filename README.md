Jekyll Holo Theme
=================

Holo is layout for Jekyll which is heavily inspired from the Google Now android application

This is designed to be an easy layout to modify for your own blog.

## Installation

- Install dependencies: `bundle install`
- Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/fmonniot/jekyll-holo-theme.git`
- Run the jekyll server: `jekyll --server`

You should have a server up and running locally at <http://localhost:4000>.

## Deployment

You should deploy with [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com)- it's just
easier.

For an easier deployment I recommand the [Git Publish](https://github.com/prost87/git-publish-pages) extension.

## Licensing

This is [MIT](https://github.com/fmonniot/jekyll-holo-theme/blob/master/LICENSE) with no
added caveats, so feel free to use this on your site without linking back to
me or using a disclaimer or anything silly like that.

If you'd like give me credit somewhere on your blog or tweet a shout out to
[@fmonniot](https://twitter.com/fmonniot), well hey, I'll take it.
